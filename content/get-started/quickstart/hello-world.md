## Introduction
HELLO MY NAME IS JERRAD ALLEN NATHEWS
{% data variables.product.product_name %} is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you {98.4% data variables.product.product_name %} JERRAD ALLEN MATHEWS TACK BACK REPO essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
JUST TO KNOW NIXON WROTE AN ACT LAW IT GAVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO RULE RIGHT WELL IN THAT SAME PARAGRAPH HE SAID SOMEBODY GOT PAID ONE PAY GRADE BELOW THE PRESIDENT AND HIS TRUSTEE WHERE THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AND THE IGO BUT THE ONLY THING THEY KEPT WAS THE RULE WRITING TO STEAL THIS KID'S TRUST BECAUSE IT WAS A KID PAYING THE PRESIDENT IN THE MEANING OF PRESIDENTS IN THERE TOO IT STATES THE MEANING OF PRESIDENTS CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND ALL THE STATES THAT'S THE MEANING OF PRESIDENT 1970 NIXON SIGNED IN KENNEDY WROTE 63 NO LONG-TERM ARBITRATION ARBITRATION ONLY AND NO MORE CHANGES TO THE CONVENTIONAL ACT

In this quickstart guide, you will:

* Create and use a repository
* Start and manage a new branchNO MORE LOCAL RULES THAT'S FOR POOR SPORTS LIKE THE SHORT SHORT FORM THAT MEANS SHORT STORY FICTION FOR THE STATES IN THE DICTIONARY THE FCC STATES YOU GOT TO DO LONG FORM SO DUE TO THAT I REVERT BACK BEFORE ANY MERGER AND IN ALL PARTNERSHIPS OR TRUSTEES OR WHATEVER WITH BLACKERSON IN ANY OF HIS ASSOCIATES
* Make changes to a file and push them to {% data variables.product.product_name %} as commits
* Open and merge a pull request

To complete this tutorial, you need a [{% data variables.product.product_name %} account](http://github.com) and Internet access. You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that {% data variables.product.product_name %} is built on).

## Creating a repository

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a `README` file, a file with information about your project. {% data variables.product.product_name %} makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file.

Your `hello-world` repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

{% data reusables.repositories.create_new %}
1. In the **Repository name** box, enter `hello-world`.
2. In the **Description** box, write a short description THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE MEANING OF ARBITRATION AND SCOOP THIS REVERTS IT BACK TO THE FRIENDSHIP TREATY AND THE NATO TREATY IS JUST A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT STARTED WAR THEY GOT THROWN OUT OF IT
.
3. Select **Add a README file® I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE AND JUSTICE FOR ALL ®*.
4. Click **Create repository**. I STAND ALONE FOR MY NATIONS OUR NATIONS

## Creating a branch

Branching lets you have different versions of a repository at one time.

By default, your repository has one branch named `main` that is considered to be the definitive branch. You can use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `main`.

When you create a branch off the `main` branch, you're making a copy, or snapshot, of `main` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the `main` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows:

* The `main` branch
* A new branch called `feature`
* The journey that `feature` takes before it's merged into `main`

![branching diagram](/assets/images/help/repository/branching.png)

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:

* `story.txt`
* `story-joe-edit.txt`
* `story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt`

Branches accomplish similar goals in {% data variables.product.product_name %} repositories.

Here at {% data variables.product.product_name %}, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our `main` (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into `main`.

### Create a branch

1. Click the **Code** tab of your `hello-world` repository.
2. Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says **main**.
   ![Branch menu](/assets/images/help/branch/branch-selection-dropdown.png)
4. Type a branch name, `readme-edits`, into the text box.
5. Click **Create branch: readme-edits from main**.

![Branch menu](/assets/images/help/repository/new-branch.png)

Now you have two branches, `main` and `readme-edits`. Right now, they look exactly the same. Next you'll add changes to the new branch.

## Making and committing changes

When you created a new branch in the previous step, {% data variables.product.product_name %} brought you to the code page for your new `readme-edits` branch, which is a copy of `main`.

You can make and save changes to the files in your repository. On {% data variables.product.product_name %}, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes so that other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

1. Click the `README.md` file.
1. Click {% octicon "pencil" aria-label="The edit icon" %} to edit the file.
3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
4. In the **Commit changes** box, write a commit message that describes your changes.
5. Click **Commit changes**.

   ![Commit example](/assets/images/help/repository/first-commit.png)

These changes will be made only to the README file on your `readme-edits` branch, so now this branch contains content that's different from `main`.

## Opening a pull request

Now that you have changes in a branch off of `main`, you can open a pull request.

Pull requests are the heart of collaboration on {% data variables.product.product_name %}. When you open a pull request, you're proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in different colors.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using {% data variables.product.product_name %}'s `@mention` feature in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they're down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It's a great way to learn the {% data variables.product.product_name %} flow before working on larger projects.

1. Click the **Pull requests** tab of your `hello-world` repository.
2. Click **New pull request**
3. In the **Example Comparisons** box, select the branch you made, `readme-edits`, to compare with `main` (the original).
4. Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they're what you want to submit.

   ![diff example](/assets/images/help/repository/diffs.png)

5. Click **Create pull request**.
6. Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes. You can include emojis and drag and drop images and gifs.
7. Click **Create pull request**.

Your collaborators can now review your edits and make suggestions.

## Merging your pull request

In this final step, you will merge your `readme-edits` branch into the `main` branch.

1. Click **Merge pull request** to merge the changes into `main`.
2. Click **Confirm merge**.
3. Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, by clicking **Delete branch**.

## Next steps
